# A bit about me

Hey! My name is Edgar, I'm a technology and entrepreneur by heart that studied Aerospace engineer and MBA and has been working
mainly as software engineer.

I have over +6 years of professional software and teaching experience. I've worked with serveral front-end and back-end technologies and also DevOps and Cloud ones such as:
React, Vue, Node, Nest, Next, AWS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, MySQL or Docker.
