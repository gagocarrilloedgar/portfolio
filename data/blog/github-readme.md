# Github pro style profile

> This blog post is under construction and will be be ready soon

During the year 2021 github released several "hidden" features that not all users know about and make your profile look great.

One of these features is to add a special _README.md_ in your repository that makes it appear before it goes on your profile and serves as a cover letter.

Adding this file is not difficult at all and makes your profile look like the following:

![My profile image](/static/images/posts/github-readme/image.png)

To be able to add a README.md with style with the previous one, you just have to follow the following steps:

1. Go to the + button of your profile and select create a new repository:

Once you are in the process of creating your new repository you have to:

2. Add a default README.md and define the name of your new repository with the same name as your github user:

![Github profile README.md settings](/static/images/posts/github-readme/image.png)

As you can see, the special repository will be unlocked. Once created, you simply have to customize the README.md as you like.

Keep in mind that you can use HTML syntax to give it a more personal and beautiful style.

I leave you here my profile so you can get ideas!
